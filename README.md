# Crypto Tracker 🚀💰

Crypto Tracker is a web application that allows you to track the latest cryptocurrency prices, changes in market data, and other relevant information in real-time. The application displays detailed information for various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Solana, and others, using **sample data** for testing and demo purposes.

- Embedded 7-day charts for each cryptocurrency (using sample data).
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
